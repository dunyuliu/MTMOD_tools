This folder contains datasets for Dr. Laura Wallace's lecture and tutorials. Information of 5 datasets are provided and also downloaded in this folder. Below are details. 

(1) The Hikurangi Geometry from Williams et al. is in their electronic supplement. Go here for these: https://www.seismosoc.org/Publications/SRL/SRL_84/srl_84-6_williams_et_al-esupp/

(2) Calum Chamberlains relocated catalog (2009 onwards) could be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/6763130#.Yuv7HnbMI2y  Also downloaded as a .csv file in the subfolder /Chamberlain_eq_catalog.

(3) Ian Hamling's slip model (from his 2017 Science paper) is in the subfolder /hamling_coseismic_model. There are two models there, one is his crustal fault only model for the EQ, and the other is crustal faults plus subduction zone.

(4) The slip model from the USGS finite fault model for the Kaikoura earthquake (based on seismological data, not geodetic data), this is file Kaikoura_usgs_finite_fault.fsp.

(5) post Kaikoura SSE and afterslip (from Wallace et al., 2018). Two sets, one is a subfolder /W18_sse_time_evolution_total_slip with a timeseries of slip (from just after the earthquake through late 2017; these are the files starting with "kuni"), and the other is a file in the same subfolder with total slip through the entire event called W18_total_post_kaikoura_sse.txt. A README.txt is attached in the subfolder as well to describe the format of both of these files.
